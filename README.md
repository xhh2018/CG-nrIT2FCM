This software implements the approach presented in my paper:
A Method of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets Generation for Remote Sensing Imagery Classification

Please cite this paper when using this software.

Using the code:
Everything was done in Matlab.

1. When you run the program "MainT1fcm.m" in MATLAB, you can get the result of T1FCM method.

2. Runing "MainT2fcm.m" in matlab,you can obtain the results of m-IT2FCM and s-IT2FCM method.

3. Runing "MainT2fcmnr.m" in matlab,you can obtain the results of nr-IT2FCM method.

4. When you run the program "MainFGFCM.m" in MATLAB, you can get the result of FGFCM method.
